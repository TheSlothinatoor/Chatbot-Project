There is a main file called "chatbot.py" which is the final bot.
Do not edit this unless you are adding code which has been tested and is working.

Everyone has a "test" file called by their name e.g. I have Nik.py which is where I'll do my editting and testing. Once im happy I
would copy the code across to the the main "chatbot.py" file.
